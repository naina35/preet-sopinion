This is going to be my personal website where i post my thoughts, movie reviews, and stories etc.
I think of it as a brain dump to read when I'm old.
It's current purpose is to help me learn React.
Although I think learning libraries/frameworks that change every 1 or 2 years is a waste of time. but more of that i will post on the website.
